## My process

- I created a basic HTML based on the qsemantics according to the desktop version of the site.
- I added the necessary extra HTML tags to help me later achieve the design provided.
- I built the CSS for the Mobile version.
- I progressively moved up to the desktop version checking if breakpoints where needed.
- I refactored the CSS using **BEM** and added more semantic to the project.
- I checked and fixed any **a11y** issue I found.

I have used **SASS** as CSS preprocessor and **PUG** as an HTML preprocessor.  
I have included a short script (build.js) to compile those source files.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [a11y](developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) - Accesibility
- [PUG](https://pugjs.org/) - HTML Preprocessor
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor
- [BEM](https://en.bem.info/) - CSS Methodology

### What I learned

I picked up this simple challenge to start with a small context and blend every good styling  
practices I found in a proper way.

I learned **BEM** which helps me refactor my styles so that they can become easy to mantain in  
the future.

I'm in the process of learning ARIA and the little bit I studied about it also puts me in the  
direction of keeping a good semantic narrative on my files.
